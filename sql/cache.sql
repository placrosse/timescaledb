CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS  _timescaledb_cache.cache_inval_hypertable();

-- This is pretty subtle. We create this dummy cache_inval_extension table
-- solely for the purpose of getting a relcache invalidation event when it is
-- deleted on DROP extension. It has no related triggers. When the table is
-- invalidated, all backends will be notified and will know that they must
-- invalidate all cached information, including catalog table and index OIDs,
-- etc.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS  _timescaledb_cache.cache_inval_extension();

-- not actually strictly needed but good for sanity as all tables should be dumped.
